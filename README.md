To load the Khodayari model, download the Supplementary file 4 (1-s2.0-S1096717614000731-mmc4.xlsx) from

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096717614000731?via%3Dihub#s0090

and put it in Model_Comparison/Khodayari_Model/ModelData/

For the other models, I made new files so that the python code easily import them (please contact me if this violates the authors' copyright).
